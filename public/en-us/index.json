You can now send your invoices by post from anywhere with just one click. After installing the app, you have the option to select a document (invoices, credit memos, reminder, quotes und orders) and send it using the following familiar sending options:\n Black/white or color Sending abroad Registered mail (posting/return receipt) Duplex printing  Report adaptation to a specific Deutsche Post template format is not necessary. A cover letter with the correct dimensions is available. Subsequently, the posted sales invoice is transmitted to Deutsche Post.

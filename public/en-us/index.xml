You can set this up in the user setup. Go to the search and look for &amp;ldquo;User Setup&amp;rdquo;, if the user does not already exist, add it to the setup. Then put another check mark in the &amp;ldquo;Attachment Plus&amp;rdquo; field.
Repeat this process until your license capacity is used up.</description>

Start by opening the report selection of the report you want, in this example we will use Sales and Invoices. If you are not sure where to find the report selector, you can always use the Dynamics 365 Business Central search feature.</description>

These can be changed under “Countries/Region“ in Business Central, the fastest way to find this point is via the search function.
There you change the field “VAT Scheme“ to the code for the corresponding country. The code for Germany is 9930, all other codes can be found here.</description>

        <description>Setup Checking the VAT Scheme You should check the VAT scheme codes for the respective countries. For XRechnung, this is normally only Germany.
These can be changed under “Countries/Region“ in Business Central, the fastest way to find this point is via the search function.
There you change the field “VAT Scheme“ to the code for the corresponding country. The code for Germany is 9930, all other codes can be found here.</description>

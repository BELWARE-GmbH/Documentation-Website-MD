### Introduction 

For cases where you want to deliver created reports by fax, this app offers a solution. 
The prerequisite is that you operate a fax server that you can address for sending. Then this app first creates the report to be sent as an email, which is then sent to the fax server via SMTP. From there, the original email is then delivered as a fax. 
In the first version of SMTP2FAX, the functionality is available for the pages: 

- Posted sales invoices 
- Posted sales credit notes 
- Registered reminders
- Purchasing orders

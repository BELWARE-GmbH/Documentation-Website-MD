### SMTP2FAX in the document layouts 

For specifying the recipient's fax number, on the one hand, the field available in the Business Central Standard is available in the card of the creditor or debtor. However, the SMTP2FAX app also adds another field to the document layouts table, where you can specify the fax number for different use cases. 

Its use in the workflow is explained in [Working with SMTP2FAX](en-us/apps/smtp2fax/working-with-smtp2fax/).

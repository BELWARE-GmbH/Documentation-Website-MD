### SMTP2FAX in Connector 365 Setup 

To get to SMTP2FAX setup, simply open the search and enter Connector 365 setup there. There you will find the section SMTP2FAX Setup. 

At this point, you just need to specify the domain of the fax server. The address to which a fax is sent is automatically composed of the recipient's fax number, the @ sign and the specified domain. 

Another place where settings for the use of SMTP2FAX can be made are the [document layouts](en-us/apps/smtp2fax/first-steps/setup/doclayout/) of debtors and creditors.

### SMTP2FAX in E-Mail Outbox

If a fax was saved as a draft via the dialog or if the transmission failed, it is entered accordingly in the Business Central e-mail outbox. 

  

  

There the message can be deleted or resent. 

  

If, on the other hand, the message has been sent successfully, it is entered in the list of sent mails.

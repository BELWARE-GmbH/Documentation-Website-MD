### Upgrade from the Connector 365 setup
Setup in the usual sense is not necessary for the Upgrade App. However, the control that triggers the data transfer is located in the Connector 365 setup.

You can use the Business Central search function to access the Connector 365 setup:
![](/images/apps/Base/search_connector_setup_en.png)

In the "Actions" menu on this page
![](/images/apps/Upgrade%20App/connector_setup_actions.png)

the button "Transfer"
![](/images/apps/Upgrade%20App/connector_setup_transfer.png)

The exact functionality of this button is explained in [Using the Connector 365 Upgrade App](en-us/apps/connector-upgrade/using-the-upgrade-app/).

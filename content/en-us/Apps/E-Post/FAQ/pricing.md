### FAQ

#### how does the pricing work?

The app itself costs 9,90â‚¬/month and can be ordered via our [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=wbg8p1B5wk60E37fEWJ6gK10RbLPyuxOs2bKXXZxm8JUNFRLRzBKUEQ0MTVIOEsxWlJPSFdTMVNNQy4u). The license allows you to send an unlimited number of letters with an unlimited number of users.

During the sending, the usual postage costs of the Deutsche Post are incurred, the Deutsche Post bills these directly with you.

After the download you have the following test options:

**No registered E-POST customer**
You will receive a message when testing the app stating that there would be a letter dispatch at this point.

**Registered E-POST customer**
The following options are available to you as a registered E-POST customer:

- Test mode sending - you will receive the letter by mail to a previously specified address.
- Productive shipping - your letter will be correctly sent to the recipient.

For both options you need your EKP number. If you do not have it at hand, please contact us.

To test the app, you are allowed to send 5 letters through the app without purchasing it.
The postage costs incurred during testing will be billed directly to you via Deutsche Post.

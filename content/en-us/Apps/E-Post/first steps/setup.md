#### Set Password
To set a password for the APP, you must first click on **"Set password"** in the setup. A new dialog will now open and at the same time the admin that was specified during the E-Post registration will receive an SMS with a pin.

Enter the pin in the corresponding field and confirm the dialog with OK. The password is now set and a secret is automatically generated.

The Microsoft AppSource opens. There you can use the search function again to find the **Connector 365 E-POST**. Click on **Free Trial** to start the installation. Before the installation starts, you have to provide some contact information.

You will receive a short confirmation that the installation is being performed. This takes place fully automatically in the background

You will not be notified about the completion of the installation, but the process should not take more than a few minutes.

If everything worked, you can now find the **Connector 365 E-POST** under **Installed Extensions**.

Deutsche Post uses country names according to [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) in shipping, so if you want to use the Connector 365 E-POST App, you have to adjust the country names in the appropriate setup in your Business Central environment beforehand.

You can find the setup for this in the search under **"Countries/Regions"**. You only need to change country names in this setup which also receive letters from you, domestic shipping is not affected. Please write the country names in **capital letters**.

Here is an example of the correct setup for a shipment to the USA:

### First steps

### Fast hybrid sending with the Connector 365 E-POSTBUSINESS API APP

The need to receive invoices by mail is still ubiquitous. What does this mean for my cloud ERP Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, which can be used from anywhere? Invoice processing in the traditional sense - printing, inserting, franking and posting at the post office - can delay the process - especially if the invoice creator is not on-site. Depending on the volume of invoices to be sent, this process can become even more time-consuming - time that could be used more productively.

**Per mouse click off into the mailbox**

However, thanks to E-POST, a service from Deutsche Post, the days of sending invoices manually are over. You can now send your invoices by post from anywhere with just one click. After installing the app, you have the option to select a posted sales invoice and send it using the following familiar sending options:

- Black/white or color
- Sending abroad
- Registered mail (posting/return receipt)

Report adaptation to a specific Deutsche Post template format is not necessary. A cover letter with the correct dimensions is available. Subsequently, the posted sales invoice is transmitted to Deutsche Post. Here your invoices are processed and sent fully automatically, independent of time and in compliance with the GDPR. You can track and view the current shipping status at any time in Dynamics 365 Business Central.

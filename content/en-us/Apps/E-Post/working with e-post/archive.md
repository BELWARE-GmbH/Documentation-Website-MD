### Working with the E-POST API

### Archive

After sending the invoice, you can check the status in the joblist. This can be found in the factbox area directly on the overview of the documents. Here you can see when the letter was sent, who sent it and what the status is.

In the factbox area of the documents you can find the **Connector 365 Activities**. There you find the brief overview to each process. You can find this overview in the list view as well as the card view of the documents.
By clicking the field **Accepted at** you cand navigate the the complete overview. By clicking the field **Status** you can navigate to the detailed state overview of the process.

The page **COnnector 365 Activities** provides you with a detailed overview of all letters that have been sent. It shows which options were used and displays any error messages that may have occurred. If the option **Save file in job list** is active in the setup, you can also view the sent document. To do this simply click on the name of the file under **File name**.

### Working with the E-POST API

### Archive

After sending the invoice, you can check the status in the joblist. This can be found in the factbox area directly on the overview of the documents. Here you can see when the letter was sent, who sent it and what the status is.

The job list provides you with a detailed overview of all letters that have been sent. It shows which options were used and displays any error messages that may have occurred. If the option **"Save file in job list"** is active in the setup, you can also view the sent document. To do this, simply click on the name of the file under **"File name"**.

In the dashboard on the start page you can find the status of all sent and not yet sent documents

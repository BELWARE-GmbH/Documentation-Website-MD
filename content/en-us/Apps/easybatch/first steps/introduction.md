### First steps

### Introduction

When sending documents from your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central environment, you often want to send multiple documents at the same time, but with the Dynamics 365 Business Central standard, this is not easily possible. This makes a process that should only take a few minutes take much longer.

With the Connector 365 Easy Batch it is possible to intelligently send multiple documents at the same time, set up the desired sending method in the document layouts and simply select your receipts you want to send - One click and all receipts will be sent.

#### Compatible with other Connector 365 solutions

Connector 365 Easy Batch also supports Connector 365 XRechnung & E-POST App in batch sending.

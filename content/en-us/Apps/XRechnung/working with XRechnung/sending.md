### Working with XRechnung

### Sending

If the setup has been completed, then you can easily send invoices by email. Simply open your posted sales invoices and select the invoice you want to send.

**„Print/Send“ -> „Send as XRechnung“**

A new dialog opens where you can make adjustments before sending.

In the dialog, the sender, the recipient, the subject and also again the Ident ID can be viewed but also adjusted.
The content of the mail can be customized and the current attachments are visible.

If you have other attachments that you want to send, then you can add more attachments via the **“Attach file”** field in the menu bar.
You can find more on the topic of attachments [here](en-us/apps/xrechnung/working-with-xrechnung/attachments).

{{< notice info "Hinweis" >}}
 _If you have selected embedded attachments in the document layouts, these will also be embedded in the XML and can then only be read by machine. You have to pay attention to which attachments the recipient accepts._

If you have made the desired changes, you can trigger the dispatch via **“Send Email”**. In the background, a check for the scheme of the XRechnung is now performed.

### After sending

If the verification of the document was successful, the invoice will be sent.

After sending, the recipient will receive, among other things, a **“xml-file”**.
This is the corresponding invoice in **“XRechnung”** format.

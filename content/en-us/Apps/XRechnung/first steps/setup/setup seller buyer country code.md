### Check the Seller and Buyer Country Code

One point that must also be taken into account is setting up the country code in accordance with ISO standard 3166.
This must be entered correctly for both the seller and the buyer.

#### Seller
To set up the seller country code, navigate to **Company Information**.

#### Buyer
You can set up the buyer's country code via the card for the individual customers.

You can find more information on the correct creation of the code on the corresponding [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1).

### Setup

### Setting up the individual modules
The Connector 365 Mail Experience Plus app combines the 3 apps from our Mail Plus series into one power app. Below we will tell you how to set up each area. 


##### Mail Subject Plus area
The Mail Subject Plus area is for adding your own dynamic subject lines per report or customer to your emails. You can use placeholders to define your own content.

##### Mail Sender Plus area
Mail Sender Plus allows you to intelligently control your sender addresses per report. When used in older versions, Mail Sender Plus functions provide you with a separate mail dialog that is more user-friendly than the standard one.

##### Mail Attachments Plus area
Mail Attachments Plus allows you to control your mail attachments at various levels and specify attachments that will always be attached to specific reports when sent by default. Control for attachments over a period of time is also possible.

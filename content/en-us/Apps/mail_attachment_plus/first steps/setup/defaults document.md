### Setup

### Adding standard attachments per document

Using the Factbox, you have the option of adding standard attachments to each document, which are automatically attached when the document is sent. To do this, select the desired document in the overview and choose **"Attachments"** in the factbox on the right.

Now click on the 0 at "Documents", a window opens in which you can add attachments via **"Select file"** in the table.

Select the desired file and repeat this process until all the desired files are attached. From now on, the selected files will be sent whenever you send the selected document.

Once the attachments are set, a mail can be sent as usual, instructions on how to do this can be found in **"Working with Mail Attachment Plus"** under [Document Default Attachments](en-us/apps/mail_attachment_plus/working-with-map/defaults-document/)

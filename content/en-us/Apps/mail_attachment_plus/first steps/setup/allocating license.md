### Setup

### Assigning a license to a user
In order for a user to use the Mail Attachments Plus APP features, they must first be assigned a license. You can set this up in the user setup. Go to the search and look for **"User Setup"**, if the user does not already exist, add it to the setup. Then put another check mark in the **"Attachment Plus"** field.

Repeat this process until your license capacity is used up. If you need more users, you can order them at any time via our [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=wbg8p1B5wk60E37fEWJ6gK10RbLPyuxOs2bKXXZxm8JUNlZYRkRDRVRDM0hFVlBRNlNVT0pKWktWSy4u).

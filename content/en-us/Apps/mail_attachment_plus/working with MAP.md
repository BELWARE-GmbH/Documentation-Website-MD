### Working with Mail Attachments Plus
Once you have attached your standard attachments in the appropriate places, you can now start sending mail as usual.

You will notice that in the attachments area, the previously set up standard attachments can be found, provided that the corresponding document meets the criteria (Correct report/customer/document).

If one of the default attachments does not match what you are sending, you can easily remove it, just like with the normal attachments. Just click on the three dots next to the attachment and click **delete**.

You can, of course, add more attachments using the standard Business Central functions

When you are satisfied with your attachments, you can send the email.

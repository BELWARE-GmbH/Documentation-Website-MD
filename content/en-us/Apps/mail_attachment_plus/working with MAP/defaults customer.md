### Working with Mail Attachment Plus

After you have added the attachments you want in the report selection, you can start sending the mail. If you have not done so yet, you can find the setup of the [Customer Default Attachments](/en-us/apps/mail_attachment_plus/first-steps/setup/defaults-customer/) in the **"Getting Started"** section.

For this example, we have set up the default attachments in invoice shipping as follows:

Two PDFs are attached, each with the standards set up per document/report

{{< notice info "Note" >}}
 _If you are using a Business Central version in which the Mail Experience is not yet available, the procedure is a little different._
{{< /notice >}}

#### Mail with standard attachments per customer
To do this, simply open the report for which you previously set up your attachments and then click **"Print/Send"** and the regular **"Send by Email"** function.

The standard Microsoft Mail Experience will open, if you scroll down to the Attachments section you will find the attachments you previously set up.

since the box for attachements per report and document were ticked in the setup there are a few other attachments.

If one of the attachments does not fit, you can simply remove them as usual, via the 3 dots and **"delete"**.

Using the Mail Attachment Plus APP does not prevent you from using the attachment functionality of the standard. You can still add more attachments via the menu bar under **"Attach file"**. With a click on **"Manage"** -> **"Attach file"** this is also possible.

When you have made all the changes to your attachments, you can send your mail as usual by clicking **"Send email"**.

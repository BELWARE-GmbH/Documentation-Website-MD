### Working with Easy Batch

### Open Tasks

The page Open Tasks offers you a overview for every document, that is enqueued for processing, but was not succesfully processed yet.

Besides the planned processing time you can check the field **Error Message** for reasons why the processing failed. 

Using the action **Cancel Processing** the processing can be stopped for individual documents.

The action **Retry Task** enqueues the selected tasks to be processed again.
Only tasks that ran into an error will be considered by using this action.

Clicking the **Document No.** lets you navigate to the specific document.

After the processing succeeded the tasks will be removed from this list and afterwardsarchived in the [Connector 365 Activities](/en-us/apps/easy-batch/working-with-easy-batch/archive/).

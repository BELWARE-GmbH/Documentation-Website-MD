### Receiving E-Documents

Depending on whether you received your e-document via email or through the PEPPOL network, the process for reading your document varies. If you have received your e-document by email, you can manually upload it into the system.

If your e-document was transmitted through the PEPPOL network, you have two options:

#### Task Queue
When the Connector 365 E-Documents is activated, a task queue is set up that automatically retrieves e-documents from the BELWARE Peppol Access Point and stores them under E-documents after validation.

#### Manual Retrieval via Receiving
If you wish to bypass the task queue and manually retrieve your document directly into the system, please open the corresponding E-document service. 

You will now have access to the **Receiving** function by default. Click on this to manually trigger the goods receipt. 

In the background, your system will check for documents ready for retrieval in the Peppol network. If E-documents are available, they will be created in the system after validation; for erroneous documents, creation will occur only after a warning.

The documents manually uploaded into the system can be found under **E-documents**, just like those in the task queue. To access the E-documents, use the “Tell me” function and search for E-documents.

Here you can view all E-documents you have received.

#### Log
For both incoming and outgoing E-documents, you can view the respective status in the log. To open the log, access the E-document and display the corresponding log. Here, you can check the status and log of your E-document in the service status.

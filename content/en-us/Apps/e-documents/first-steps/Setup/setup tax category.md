### Setup

### Check the Tax Category

It is important to review the tax category, which is available in the **VAT booking matrix**. You can access this quickly using the search function.

Please ensure that the "tax category" field is populated with the appropiate designation, which you can find [here](https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/codelist/UNCL5305/). Typically, you will only need the codes E S and Z.

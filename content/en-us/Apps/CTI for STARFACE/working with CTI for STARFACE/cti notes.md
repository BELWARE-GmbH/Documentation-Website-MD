### Working with CTI for STARFACE

### Creating CTI notes
After your phone call, you have the option to write your own notes about the content of the conversation. You can do this directly from the **"Contact card"**, which should still be open after the phone call.

First select the corresponding entry in the **"CTI entries"**, now look in the right area in the factbox. There you will find the area **"CTI notes"**, with a click on the field name, you have the possibility to write a new note.

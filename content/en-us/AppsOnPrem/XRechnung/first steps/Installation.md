The Microsoft AppSource will open. There you can use the search function again to find the **Connector 365 XRechnung**. Click on **Free Trial** to start the installation. Before the installation finally starts, you need to provide some contact information.

After submitting your contact information, you will be prompted to choose a language for the app. Our app is available in English and German. Then click **Install**.

You will not be notified about the completion of the installation, but the process should not take more than a few minutes.

If everything worked, you can now find the **Connector 365 XRechnung** under **Extension Management**.
